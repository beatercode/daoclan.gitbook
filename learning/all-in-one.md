## **LESSONS** üß† ****&#x20;

* Do not overdiversify, make high conviction concentrated bets. 5-15 coins in a portfolio is ideal. Diversification preserves wealth, concentration builds wealth.
* Size based on conviction (Big part of portfolio should consist of high conviction coin with higher market cap > low conviction coin with lower market cap)
* Always, always, always, take profit. But when?
*
  * When everyone is talking about it (Twitter threads and YouTube videos on ‚Äò‚ÄôWhy X is bullish‚Äô, or even your neighbor are bullish on it)
  * Price has gone parabolic in a short period of time
  * When a narrative has started for some time and already gained crazy traction, with tons of new copycats project adopting the same mechanism (eg. DeFi summer food farming, OHM forks, ve mechanism, NFT, GameFi, algostable)
  * When you feel stupid selling
  * If you bought a coin because you are expecting a certain narrative/ news to take place, sell it once the event has taken place or if your expectations are not met
  * When you want to show off your profits
  * The thesis of why you bought the project in the first place was either fulfilled or disproven (i.e. it could be team, the valuation, a narrative, etc)
  * When the founders start getting cocky and arrogant about their success
* Don‚Äôt chase the pump or narrative, always wait for dips. If you are really FOMO, buy a small bag first that‚Äôs x% of your intended size, so at least mentally you won‚Äôt keep thinking about it coz you don‚Äôt have a bag
* Don‚Äôt marry a bag, opportunity cost of holding coins that doesn‚Äôt move at all is high
* Have at least 20-30% stablecoins at all time regardless of market condition
* Get in when only a few people are talking about it. Get out when everyone is talking about it
* If found some small cap gems that may moon but have no conviction, ape small first, research later
* Projects that gone through the Phase 1 (Hype and price pump) > Phase 2 (Hype gone and price crashes) > Phase 3 (‚ÄôRevive‚Äô with organic traction) is usually a good long term bet
* Sometimes, even when everyone is talking about an upcoming narrative with strong and clear catalyst (i.e. overcrowded and probably priced in), it is still worth getting in at least a little bit instead of fading it altogether
* Second order thinking - consider the consequence of consequence of an event/ news and see if possible to profit from it.
*
  * Eg, Big metaverse project had a huge fundraising or gains lots of traction, once the gains in this project is being squeezed finish (or even before then), people will rotate the profit to another metaverse project, so you buy the another metaverse project in anticipation of the trickle down effect
* Be open minded and willing to explore new narrative. It‚Äôs always worth it to at least allocate small size into new narrative. Do not marry to old narrative.
*
  * Eg. DeFi summer > think is scam > miss the DeFi wave > convinced that DeFi is the future only after the trend has died > buy only DeFi > fade NFT > NFT boom > think NFT is scam > and the cycle repeat. Same for GameFi and any future narrative
* Think ‚Äòif I liquidate my entire position, would I buy back the same % of my bags that I hold right now?‚Äô. Follow the answer.
* Market can stay irrational (i.e. public and private projects are at ridiculous valuation, parabolic price rise) for a long time, but eventually, inevitably, it will come crumble down, no exception
* When facing existential doubt, make the decision that optimize for surviving to fight another day. If there is any FUD or uncertainty, don‚Äôt try to double down trying to make it all back in one trade, it‚Äôs best to sell and cut loss, ignore sunk cost.
* Nothing is truly long term nor guaranteed to go back up. What is good now may not be good tomorrow, don‚Äôt get too fixated on what you like now, but develop a list of projects, follow their development, feed yourself with new information, and update your thesis
* Do not try to speed up the process. You just go from $10k to $100k? Great. But you think you can do the same from $100k to $1million? Sure, some may, but most may not. You will end up giving it all back to the market.
* Most people (including established VC and KOL) are just trying to psyops you and sell you their bag, don‚Äôt fall into their trap
* For small cap illiquid pump\&dump coins or some new narrative or farm, best to get out after you have made some profit, don‚Äôt try to hodl too long expecting to 100x
* During market uncertainty, sell the small cap coins into stablecoins and blue chips that will survive the bear market (i.e. BTC, ETH)
